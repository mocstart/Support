# Visa Card

### What is Visa?

Visa is a global payment technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks, and governments, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash or checks. As a financial intermediary, Visa operates one of the most advanced and widely adopted payment processing networks in the world. While Visa is a card network, it does not issue cards or set interest rates. Instead, it provides the infrastructure for authorized issuers and cardholders to facilitate electronic funds transfers (EFT).



Although Visa primarily supports card-based transactions, it has expanded its capabilities to accommodate mobile payments, contactless payments, and blockchain-based solutions. Its adaptability is one of the key reasons individuals and organizations choose Visa when seeking diversified payment options.

### How Visa Works

Key steps in Visa’s payment processing include:

1. Issuing & Partnerships: Visa partners with financial institutions that issue Visa-branded cards and manage customer relationships.
2. Transaction Initiation: Cardholder transactions are routed from merchant POS systems to acquiring banks.
3. Transaction Routing: Visa intermediates by routing data to the issuing bank for approval or denial.
4. Data Security: Employs tokenization, encryption, and multi-factor authentication.
5. Clearing & Settlement: Coordinates funds transfers between issuers and acquirers, typically on a daily batch basis.
6. Fee Structure: A small fee per transaction is shared across issuers, acquirers, and Visa.
7. Analytics & Reporting: Provides businesses with detailed transaction data for operational insights.

Visa also offers APIs and SDKs, allowing seamless integration of payment functionalities across digital platforms, supporting both domestic and cross-border operations.

### Requirements for Businesses to Accept Visa 

To begin accepting Visa payments, businesses typically need to establish a merchant account with an acquiring bank or payment processor. In many cases, integrated providers (e.g., Stripe) already include Visa acceptance as part of their services.

Once onboarded, businesses deploy Visa-compatible POS systems or online payment gateways. Regardless of infrastructure, compliance with PCI DSS standards is mandatory to ensure secure handling of cardholder data.

By integrating Visa’s APIs and SDKs, businesses gain scalable and adaptable payment solutions that operate across multiple platforms.
